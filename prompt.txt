You now have all my current scripts, lets get down to business. 

I am looking for ideas on which systems to add next to the game. I currently have:
✅ Basic player movement using WASD
✅ Camera follow
✅ Flipping to face mouse

I am looking to get this player controller flushed out as much as possible before starting any other systems. I want the player to feel fluid, somewhat juicy? and overall fun to play.

This game is taking inspiration from:
✅ DayZ - DayZ's player controller is very well thought out, it is the go to when someone thinks "survival" as it is quite hard core. I want to capture that, but in 2D! I feel this could be really fun if done right. I also like some of the HUD elements, including the inventory.
✅ Sheltered - I have recently been playing a lot of the original sheltered. It's dynamic weather events, day / night cycle and dynamic events really drawn me in. The resource management was fun, watching your resources drain was scary but exciting and had me hoping for rain

So as you have seen, I have the basic movement but that is all. What do you think? What would you recommend? Am I right in thinking sound should be something I get started on ASAP? This would open up some player feedback as well as footsteps and other essential systems?
